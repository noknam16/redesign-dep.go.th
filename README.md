## Redesiging dep.go.th for a case study
### About
This is my first time ever attempting web development. I have zero background in coding but I want to learn how to do it. This is my baby steps, my playground, my experimental lab, etc. You can expect pretty much a mess. 
P.S. The nauseating background colors you see is just my way of differentiating containers.

### Still Want to Have a Look? Okay
[Visit my WIP page here](dep.go.th/home.html) <span>But beware since it's still very "in-progress".</span>
